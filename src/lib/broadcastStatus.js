/**
 * Broadcast status vocabulary — the single definition for the whole app.
 *
 * The keys are the ones the server actually writes: `campaigns.status` defaults
 * to 'scheduled', the scheduler claims a due row as 'sending' before it sends a
 * single message, marks it 'sent' afterwards, and cancelling sets 'cancelled'. Anything else is a row the bot will never send, so it gets
 * a fallback that says so rather than an empty badge — the page previously
 * rendered a status it did not recognise as no badge at all, which read as a
 * styling bug rather than as the data problem it was.

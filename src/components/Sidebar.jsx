/**
 * Navigation, ordered the way the established WhatsApp Business platforms
 * order theirs (WATI, Interakt, respond.io, AiSensy all converge on this):
 *
 *   1. A flat list. None of them nest, and none of them label a section that
 *      holds one item — which is what "Team Management → Team" was.
 *   2. Grouped by hairline rule, not by heading. Seven text headings over
 *      eight items is more chrome than navigation, and a rule is this
 *      system's own device (DESIGN.md §5).
 *   3. Ordered by how often it is opened, not by how the database is shaped.
 *      The inbox is the surface an operator lives in, so it sits at the top,
 *      under the overview.
 *   4. Named for the job, not the table. Every one of those platforms says
 *      Inbox, Contacts, Broadcasts and Automation; not Messages, Campaigns
 *      and Bot Config.
 *
 * `divider: true` opens a new band above the item.

/**
 * The one ink panel in the app.
 *
 * DESIGN.md asks for ink to be used sparingly and for the moments that carry
 * weight; in a tool the navigation is that moment — it is the only surface
 * present on every screen, so it anchors the sheet while the working area
 * stays white. Champagne text on ink, titanium grid behind it.
 *
 * ── The left rail ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two vertical lines, and only two.
 *
 *   CONTENT     16px — the wordmark, the group labels, every nav icon, the
 *                      sign-out icon. Achieved as px-2 on each group plus
 *                      px-2 on each row, and px-4 on the header, which has no
 *                      group wrapper of its own.
 *   BACKGROUND   8px — the row highlight and the active rail. They belong to
 *                      the row, not to the text column, so they are held one
 *                      step outside the content line; that offset is what
 *                      lets the column still read as a column.
 *
 * It previously ran on three unrelated edges — the logo at 20px, the labels
 * and icons at 24px, the rail at 12px — which is what made the group headings
 * look adrift from the items beneath them.
 *
 * Label text lands at 16 + 18 (icon) + 14 (gap-3) = 48px, matching the
 * header's logo-to-wordmark gap. Collapsed, every row centres on the same
 * 40px axis because the inset is px-2 in both states.

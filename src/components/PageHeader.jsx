/**
 * The admin's answer to the site's <SectionHeader>: eyebrow → title → intro,
 * with an optional action rail on the right.
 *
 * Carries two of the four signature elements DESIGN.md §5 asks for, because
 * this is the hero of every screen:
 *
 *   .grid-paper      the 34px measured drawing sheet, as an absolutely
 *                    positioned aria-hidden layer behind the hero, bleeding
 *                    to the edges of the working area and fading out before
 *                    it reaches the content below.
 *   .titanium-sheen  the brushed-metal gradient clipped to the h1. Available
 *                    behind `sheen`, but OFF by default: its lightest stop is
 *                    #8F887C, which reads as washed-out grey next to the solid
 *                    ink of every card title and table head on the same
 *                    screen. A console wants its headings dark. Pass
 *                    `sheen` to bring the gradient back on one page.
 *
 * The h1 is `.display-1`, per §3: that class is the page h1, one per page.
 * `.display-2` is a section h2 and belongs on the cards below.
 *
 * Never hand-roll a page heading. Everything a screen says about itself goes
 * through here, so the rhythm is the same on all fifteen and a new page
 * cannot quietly invent its own.
